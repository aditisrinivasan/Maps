Creating colour coded maps in R

```{r malaria-aids}
library(rworldmap)

theCountries <- c("DEU", "COD", "BFA")
# These are the ISO3 names of the countries you'd like to plot in red

malDF <- data.frame(country = c("DEU", "COD", "BFA", "IND", "RUS"),
  diseases = c(1, 1, 1, 2, 2) )
# malDF is a data.frame with the ISO3 country names plus a variable to
# merge to the map data

malMap <- joinCountryData2Map(malDF, joinCode = "ISO3",
  nameJoinColumn = "country")
# This will join your malDF data.frame to the country map data

mapCountryData(malMap, nameColumnToPlot="diseases", catMethod = "categorical",
  missingCountryCol = gray(.8))
# And this will plot it, with the trick that the color palette's first
# color is red
```
